Varcalc is a calculator with the following functions:

    - Values are doubles.
    - The four basic operations are supported (+, -, *. /).
    - Raising to a power is supported (^).
    - Unary + and - are supported.
    - Grouping with parentheses is supported.
    - Named variables are supported (names are like C identifiers).
    - Results may be printed using the print command.

Varcalc skips white space, but not newlines. It reads statements, one per line.
Newline ends a statement.

Statements can be:

    - <expression>
    - print <expression>
    - empty

Any text from // to the end of a line is a comment.

Assignment is an expression, so assignments can be cascaded.

Let's assume the following input:

    a = b = (23 + c)
    print 2 * a
    hello!
    print c
    print 2^(-1/2) 

Variable c is being used without a previous assignment. This is valid, the variable is
automatically initialized as 0 and a warning is printed on standard error.

This is the output:

    line 1: defining c = 0      (standard error)
    46                          (standard output)
    line 3: ERROR: hello!       (standard error)
    0                           (standard output)
    0.707107                    (standard output)

Input format for numbers is a decimal number optionally followed by an exponent 
(letter "e" followed by a signed or unsigned integer).
